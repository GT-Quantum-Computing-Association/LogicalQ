# gatech-qec-fall2023
Quantum Error Correction Project for GT Quantum Computing Association Fall 2023

This will be the repository where we store all code examples and code for the implementation, simulation, and final hardware ready code for our QECCs.

The end goal of this project is to run the $\[\[7,1,3\]\]$ code on Quantinuum's H1-1 QC and observe a logical fidelity increase in the encoded qubit.
