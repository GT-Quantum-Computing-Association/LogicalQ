# LogicalQ

Georgia Tech Quantum Computing Association's Quantum Error Correction Project

This is the repository where we store all code, tests, and demos for the implementation, simulation, and final hardware-ready code for our QEC toolkit.

The end goal of this project is to provide researchers with an easy-to-learn tool for working with LogicalCircuits, an extension of Qiskit's QuantumCircuits, with generalized and optimized QEC methodology.
